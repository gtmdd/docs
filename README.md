# Gorilla Tag Mod Developer Documentation
This is the gorilla mod developer documentation, version 2024.11. We manually convert sections to Google Docs, so don't be afraid to make a spelling error.
It will be caught by a person. Contributors are welcome at any time. Before contributing to the documentation, please see ``Introduction/Contribute`` in the documentation pages.

For documentation: see [https://monkemods.xyz](https://monkemods.xyz). It will redirect to the documentation pages.

## Filename Consistency
We try and keep all Markdown files at the root of the repository.

- For a category, name it: ``category.md``
- For a category page, name it: ``category.subcategory.md``
- For any other type, add a ``!`` before the filename, like this: ``!specialfile.md``
