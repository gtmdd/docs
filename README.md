# Gorilla Tag Mod Developer Documentation (GTMDD) v2024.11
This is the gorilla mod developer documentation, version 2024.11. We manually convert sections to Google Docs, so don't be afraid to make a spelling error.
It will be caught by a person. Contributors are welcome at any time. Before contributing to the documentation, please see ``Introduction/Contribute`` in the documentation pages.

For documentation: see [https://monkemods.xyz](https://monkemods.xyz). It will redirect to the documentation pages.

## Filename Consistency
We try and keep all Markdown files at the root of the repository.

- For a category, name it: ``category.md``
- For a category page, name it: ``category.subcategory.md``
- For any other type, add a ``!`` before the filename, like this: ``!specialfile.md``

## Versioning
We have one stable release each month, always released on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd of that month. Any holdbacks may push its release date forward, for example, waiting for updated documentation on a recent update.

Our stable versions use this formatting scheme: `v[YEAR].[MONTH]`. For the December 2024 release, the version would be ``v2024.12``.

Instable versions are released when major changes are made in the codebase. Sometimes up to 5 per day. They are marked by the date.

For an instable release on December 15, 2024, you would use version ``v2024.12.15``. If there are multiple releases, it is appended by the hour the release was made. For an instable release on December 15, 2024, released at 12, use version ``v2024.12.15-12``
