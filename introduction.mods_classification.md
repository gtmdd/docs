## Mods Classification
### Legal Mods
Legal mods are mods that do not interfere with the server side of the game. These are client-side only mods that do not give you a competitive advantage.

Some of these mods include:
- Yizzi’s Camera Mod: A client-sided camera mod that lets you control the FOV, camera position, and other client-side only mod. This is NOT bannable.

### Illegal Mods
Illegal Mods give you a competitive advantage or are server-sided and interfere with the game. These include:
- ii’s Stupid Menu: A mod menu that provides many illegal mods. This is VERY bannable.
- PlayerTrakkar: A player tracker. Player trackers are a guaranteed ban with no appeal.
